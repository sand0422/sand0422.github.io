        Tips:
    For fudgier brownies, ensure you don't overbake; the toothpick test should show some moist crumbs, not be completely clean.
    If using melted butter, let it cool slightly before adding eggs to avoid cooking them.
    Avoid overmixing the batter after adding the dry ingredients.
    Consider adding chocolate chips or nuts before baking.
        Allowing the brownies to cool completely before cutting helps them hold their shape. </p>
