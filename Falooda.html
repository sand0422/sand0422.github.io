<h4> How to Make </h4>
    <!--The text for the instructions of the class for looda-->
    <p class="Looda"> First get your pot and fill it up 3/4 of the way with water. Fill your stove with medium heat. Then put noodles in as soon as it starts boiling. Wait  thirty minutes or until noodles are fully cooked. Then once noodles are done, take a strainer and pour the contents of the pot in the stariner to get just the noodles. Leave the noodles out to cool. Then once noodles are cool, get the milk and put the noodles into your other pot. Pour the milk in and put in as much flavoring as you want. Finally pour the falooda into glasses and put ice cream on top.</p>
